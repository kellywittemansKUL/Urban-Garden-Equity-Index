# Urban-Garden-Equity-Index
This repository contains the code supporting the study “Spatial equity in the climate adaptation role of urban domestic gardens: A cross-city analysis.” The framework integrates supply–demand perspectives of ecosystem services using the IPCC risk model (hazard, social vulnerability, exposure) to assess how domestic gardens contribute to climate adaptation across urban areas.

Garden ecosystem service (ES) supply was estimated from parcel-level land cover composition and contextual greenness, adapted from the Biotope Area Factor (BAF). Demand was modelled through a Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) that combines spatial indicators of heat and flood hazards, social vulnerability, and population exposure. The resulting Urban Garden Equity Index (UGEI) quantifies local mismatches between ES supply and climate adaptation demand, highlighting spatial inequities across urban areas.

All analyses were performed in R (v4.3–4.4), and the workflow is implemented in reproducible scripts. The repository provides a transferable, open-access framework for diagnosing spatial inequities in climate adaptation capacity and informing evidence-based urban planning.
